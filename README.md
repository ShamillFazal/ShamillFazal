### Hi there, I'm Shamill ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software engineer who has just landed a place on the [School of Code bootcamp](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/)! (March 2023)

I've been working as an electrician before this but always had a passion for tech and especially web3 in recent years. Outside of working hours you are 100% guaranteed to catch me in the gym for at least 2-3hours a day :grinning: I have a huge passion for health and fitness and the great outdoors.
